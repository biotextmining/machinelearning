Our results of real - time RT - PCR showed that Sl - ERF.B.3 is an abiotic stress responsive gene , which is induced by cold , heat , and flooding , but downregulated by salinity and drought. To get more insight into the role of Sl - ERF.B.3 in plant response to separate salinity and cold , a comparative study between wild type and two Sl - ERF.B.3 antisense transgenic tomato lines was achieved. Compared with wild type , Sl - ERF.B.3 antisense transgenic plants exhibited a salt stress dependent growth inhibition. This inhibition was significantly enhanced in shoots but reduced in roots , leading to an increased root to shoot ratio. Furthermore , the cold stress essay clearly revealed that introducing antisense Sl - ERF.B.3 in transgenic tomato plants reduces their cell injury and enhances their tolerance against 14â€‰d of cold stress. All these results suggest that Sl - ERF.B.3 gene is involved in plant response to abiotic stresses and may play a role in the layout of stress symptoms under cold stress and in growth regulation under salinity.

The effects of a p38 stress-activated protein kinase inhibitor, 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(-4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridynyl) imidazole (SB203580), were evaluated in a rat model of inflammatory hyperalgesia. Oral, but not intrathecal, administration of SB203580 significantly reversed inflammatory mechanical hyperalgesia induced by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant into the hindpaw. SB203580 did not, however, affect the increased levels of interleukin-1beta and cyclo-oxygenase 2 protein observed in the hindpaw following complete Freund's adjuvant injection. Intraplantar injection of interleukin-1beta into the hindpaw elicited mechanical hyperalgesia in the ipsilateral paw, as well as in the contralateral paw, following intraplantar injection of the bradykinin B(1) receptor agonist des-Arg(9)-bradykinin . Oral administration of SB203580 1 h prior to interleukin-1beta administration prevented the development of hyperalgesia in the ipslateral paw and the contralateral bradykinin B(1) receptor -mediated hyperalgesia. In addition, following interleukin-1beta injection into the ipsilateral paw, co-administration of SB203580 with des-Arg(9)-bradykinin into the contralateral paw inhibited the bradykinin B(1) receptor -mediated hyperalgesia.In human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the human bradykinin B(1) receptor , its agonist des-Arg(10)-kallidin produced a rapid phosphorylation of endogenous p38 stress-activated protein kinase .

		docInString.add("Current evidence has suggested the possible involvement of ROS as signaling messengers in IL-1beta - or LPS-induced gene expression. We previously reported that both IL-1beta and LPS induce uPA in RC-K8 human lymphoma cells. Here, we provide evidence that ROS-generating anthracycline antibiotics, including doxorubicin and aclarubicin, upregulate uPA expression in 2 human malignant cell lines, RC-K8 and H69 small-cell lung-carcinoma cells. Both doxorubicin and aclarubicin markedly increased uPA accumulation in RC-K8- and H69-conditioned medium in a dose-dependent manner. In each case, maximal induction was observed at a sublethal concentration, i.e., at a concentration where cell growth was slightly inhibited. Both doxorubicin and aclarubicin increased uPA mRNA levels, and induction in each case reached the maximal level 9 hr after stimulation. Doxorubicin barely changed the half-life of uPA mRNA and activated uPA gene transcription. Antioxidants such as NAC and PDTC inhibited doxorubicin-induced uPA mRNA accumulation. Microarray analysis, using Human Cancer CHIP version 2 (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan), in which 425 human cancer-related genes were spotted on glass plates, revealed that uPA is 1 of 3 genes that were clearly upregulated in H69 cells by doxorubicin stimulation. These findings suggest that the anthracycline induces uPA in human malignant cells by activating gene transcription in which ROS may be involved. Therefore, by upregulating uPA expression, the anthracycline may influence many biologic cell functions mediated by the uPA / plasmin system.

The homotetrameric aquaporin-2 ( AQP2 ) water channel is essential for the concentration of urine and of critical importance in diseases with water dysregulation, such as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis and pre-eclampsia. The structure of human AQP2 is a prerequisite for understanding its function and for designing specific blockers. To obtain sufficient amounts of AQP2 for structural analyses, we have expressed recombinant his-tagged human AQP2 (HT- AQP2 ) in the baculovirus/insect cell system. Using the protocols outlined in this study, 0.5 mg of pure HT- AQP2 could be obtained per liter of bioreactor culture. HT- AQP2 had retained its homotetrameric structure and exhibited a single channel water permeability of 0.93+/-0.03x10(-13) cm3/s, similar to that of other AQPs. Thus, the baculovirus/insect cell system allows large-scale expression of functional recombinant human AQP2 that is suitable for structural studies.

Protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) consists of 3 subunits: the catalytic subunit, C, and the regulatory subunits, A and B. The A and C subunits both exist as 2 isoforms (alpha and beta) and the B subunit as multiple forms subdivided into 3 families, B, B' and B'. It has been reported that the genes encoding the Aalpha and Abeta subunits are mutated in various human cancers, suggesting that they may function as tumor suppressors. We investigated whether Aalpha and Abeta mutations occur in human gliomas. Using single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing, 58 brain tumors were investigated, including 23 glioblastomas, 19 oligodendrogliomas and 16 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Only silent mutations were detected in the Aalpha gene and no mutations in the Abeta gene. However, in 43% of the tumors, the level of Aalpha was reduced at least 10-fold. By comparison, the levels of the Balpha and Calpha subunits were mostly normal. Our data indicate that these tumors contain very low levels of core and holoenzyme and high amounts of unregulated catalytic C subunit.

		docInString.add("The diazo compound, 2,2'-azobis [2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl) propane] dihydrochloride (AIPC), is a water-soluble radical initiator that can be activated at mild temperatures (37 degrees -40 degrees C). Potential biomedical applications of this compound include the fabrication of hydrogels by radical polymerization (e.g., cell encapsulation or drug delivery) and the thermal sensitization of cancerous cells to induce localized cell death. In this study we evaluated whether this compound could induce cell death at 37 degrees C in vitro and in vivo using a tumor animal model. Cytotoxicity was quantitated with a sulfo-rhodamine B colorimetric assay by monitoring growth inhibition of human glioma cells in vitro. AIPC was entrapped in fibrin gel and exposed to cells in culture as a potential way to localize the compound in a controlled release environment. The mechanism of action for cell death was evaluated by quantitating caspase-3 activity in cells. In vivo studies included human glioma tumors that were grown subcutaneously in rats to study the effect of intra-tumor injections of AIPC. AIPC was also injected subcutaneously into normal tissue. Concentrations of 0.2% and 0.02% (w/v in RPMI medium) showed 93% and 84% inhibition of cell growth in vitro, respectively. Cell-growth inhibition using gel-entrapped AIPC was comparable to that obtained with AIPC in solution after 48 hr (86% inhibition at 0.2% w/v). Exposure to AIPC resulted in a significant increase of caspase activity (up to 163 units after 20 min), suggesting induced apoptosis as a possible mechanism of action of the AIPC. Histological pictures showed that, relative to normal tissue, cancerous tissue was more sensitive to the effects of AIPC. Cell-killing potential of a water-soluble radical initiator.

		docInString.add("The non-isotopic assay (NIRCA), based on the observation that RNAse is able to specifically cleave a single mismatch in RNA/RNA duplexes, has been recently proposed to detect p53 mutations. To verify the use of this method as a valid screening for P53 mutations in a routinely collected cancer series, we used this assay on 3 cases with normal and 5 cases with abnormal P53 expression detected by Western blots. In all cases, P53 exons 5-6, 7 and 8-9 regions were analyzed. There were mutations only in the five overexpressed cases: two cases showed mutations in exon 5, one between intron 6 and exon 6 and two in the region spanning exons 8 and 9. Our experience showed NIRCA to be fast, reliable and providing the ability to study long target regions in a single step, thus making this assay useful for genetic screenings.
